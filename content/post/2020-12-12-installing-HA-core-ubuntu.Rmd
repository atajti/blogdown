## ...well after support is ended

I'd like to get deeper into home automation, so after watching
hours of Youtube videos and reading several pages of blog posts,
I decided to order a smart plug and smart light to test how can I
fire up a basic constellation and what can I use these for.

My initial plan was to buy a Rapsberry Pi as a hub, but I couldn't
wait long enough, so decided to install Home Assistant onto my old
Ubuntu 14.04. I tried to follow
[this (actually great) guide](https://www.raspberryfield.life/2020/06/14/getting-started-with-home-assistant-core-installing/)
but I ran into some problems.

## Short list of pitfalls and realizations

 - HA Core can be installed if python3.8 is installed.
 - Python3.8 nac be built from source on this old OS, but
   not installed via a simle `apt-get install` command.
 - Instead of `make install` I should use `make altinstall`,
   as the system uses python2, and I already had python3.4 installed
 - Python 3.8 can be built beautifully and Venv can be
   created without any problem, but `pip` will fail as
   old - or no - ssl library is installed
 - Installing openssl from source can be tricky, as it
   will not find the right `lib` folder
 - After `openssl version -v`  finally printed what I hoped for,
   `make test` did not succeed as I did not updated the envirnment variables

So after all these hurdles, here are my eventual steps for installing
Home Assistant to Ubuntu 14.04, at 12 dec 2020:

### 1.: check if you have the right openssl library - if not, install it

You can run `openssl version -v` as a litmus test to find out if you need
to bother with this. If it is `OpenSSL 1.1.1` or later (as
[those are supported](https://www.openssl.org/source/) and required for building
python with ssl), you're good to go to the next steps. If not, stay with me.

#### Build it from source

To install openssl from source to make python work,
[this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59472813) was almost perfect.
Instead of the multiflagged config I ran it without any flags. Also, after
installation, I had to create the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` based on
[this blog post](https://www.bswen.com/2018/11/others-Openssl-version-cause-error-when-loading-shared-libraries-libssl.so.1.1.html)
instead of adding the `openssl` directory to path.
to have it working after next login, I put the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/openssl/lib` row at the end of my `~/.bashrc` file
after creating the `lib` folder and copying every `lib*` file into it.

So just:
 - Download and extract the source into a folder named `openssl`,
 - run `./config && make && sudo make install` in the folder,
 - create a `lib` folder, abd copy every file into it which starts with `lib`,
 - write `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/openssl/lib` to the end of `~/.bashrc`

### 2.: Install Python3.8 from source

After downloading and extracting the [last edition of
python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-386/),
I followed the [first link of the previous section](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59472813).
Modified the `Modules/Setup` file as it is written and started the
configure - make - make test - make altinstall loop, but that was not enough.
However, make sure you use `make **alt**install`, as that will leave your OS's
python version intact.

After these steps, `make test` failed as subprocess tests with empty environment
did not run, but I did not found the origin of this issue. However, I found
the original ssl issue report, and [in a reply](https://bugs.python.org/issue34028#msg358487)
found [another setting](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001435926-Installing-OpenSSL-locally-under-your-username)
which I did not tried before: setting  the `LDFLAGS` env variable with the
path to my `openssl` directory as follows:
`export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/openssl/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/openssl/lib"`

## Enjoy

After setting this, the subprocess error did not appeared again,so I could
continue with the original guide, create a virtual environment and
install Home Assistant. When started `hass`, it just hanged - but
I did not worry, as this is written in the guide, so I assumed I'll
see the `Starting Home Assistant` line in the logs. **Wrong**. It already 
started up without printing anything. so I could delve into the possibilities
of just a smart plug.
